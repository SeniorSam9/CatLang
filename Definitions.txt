- the lexer defines the lexemes which are the most basic unit in the expression
- the parser gives you its type (returns the type of the lexemes) is it an id, literals, operation, comments, etc
- those types are called tokens 
- AST: stands for Abstract Syntax Tree and can be referred as The Parser Tree 
    - focuses on defining the order of execution and the type of each node
